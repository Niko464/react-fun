# react-fun - This will host some stuff I made in react

## <ins> Animated Number

Features:

- I want it to start at 0 and go to the targetNumber in a fixed amount of time
- I want to be able to set a unit for example "M" for Million or "$" for dollars etc. Basically setting an optional prefix and suffix.
- I want to be able to set the targetNumber with a function, to be able to change it with an api call response.
- I want it to do the animation only when it's in the user's view port

Requirements:

npm install react-scroll-trigger react-spring
